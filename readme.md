# battlecity-rs

Simple 4 player Battle City game clone written in rust

This project is a rewrite of my 10 years old project [BattleCity](https://github.com/PsychoSanchez/BattleCity) written in C++.

It uses the [piston graphics](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/graphics) for rendering game window, graphics and handling events. The game logic is written in pure rust. Project is cross-platform and should work on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
